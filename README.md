The app allows any registered user to choose the role of being a listener or mentor. As a mentor, the user can create different topics of dollar(CAD or USD) per hour ranging from $0 to $50 per hour, as well as his/her open time slots for the near future. As a listener, the user can explore and search for topics hosted by different mentors and choose to book the topic and available time slot. The listener can book any topic he wish and prepay for the cost of the session. Upon receiving a booking request, the mentor can choose to accept or decline the request based on his/her freewill. For an accepted booking, both the listener and mentor must be present in the app during the time slot and will be able to talk to each other via voice call. After the conclusion of the session, the payment for the topic and time slot will be be delivered to the mentor.
